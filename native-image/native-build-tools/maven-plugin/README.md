# Use Maven to Build a Java Application from a Java Application

The demo application simulates the traditional [fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)) Unix program.
The data for the fortune phrases is provided by [YourFortune](https://github.com/your-fortune).

The project uses the [Maven plugin for GraalVM Native Image building](https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/maven-plugin.html).

You can find the steps to run this demo in the [Optimize a Native Executable for File Size guide](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/guides/optimize-for-file-size/).
